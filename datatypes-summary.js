// datatypes are divided into two categories: primitive and non-primitive
// this is based on how they are stored in memory and how they are accessed

// Primitive 
// 7 types: Number, BigInt, String, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol
/*
Boolean: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.
Null: A special keyword denoting a null value, representing the intentional absence of any object value.
Undefined: A top-level property whose value is not defined; it indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers (e.g., 42, 3.14).
BigInt: An arbitrary-precision integer type that can represent integers larger than 
((2^53) - 1)  (e.g., 9007199254740992n).
String: A sequence of characters used to represent text (e.g., "Hello").
Symbol: A unique and immutable data type primarily used as object property keys.

// Non-Primitive (Reference), because they are stored as references in memory and accessed by reference not by value
// array, object, function
// Object: A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or a Symbol) and each value is any data type.
// Array: A list of elements, where each element can be of any data type.
// Function: A JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.
